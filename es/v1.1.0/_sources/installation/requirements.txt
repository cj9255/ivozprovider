System requirements
*******************
IvozProvider is designed to be installed using Debian GNU/Linux APT package
system.

.. important:: It's recommended to install IvozProvider in a dedicated server
   for the platform. Many of the installed software may not work properly with
   other pre-installed services (like MySQL or DNS servers).

For a StandAlone installation, we recommend at least:

    * 4 CPUs (x86_64 or i386)
    * 4 Gb memory
    * 30GB HDD
    * 2 IP Addresses (preferably public)

If you're not using a :ref:`Automatic ISO CD image` you will also need:

    * Debian Jessie 8.0 base install
    * Internet access
